# DevOps Templates

A centralized repository of reusable, scalable DevOps templates to bootstrap infrastructure, configuration management, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines across projects.

## 🧩 Overview

This repository is structured to offer modular, versionable components for:

- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform (AWS-focused)
- **Configuration Management** with Ansible
- **Monitoring & Observability** via Prometheus & Grafana
- **Deployment Automation** using GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- **Shell Utilities** for local operations and automation scripts

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyok1m/devops-templates.git
cd devops-templates
```
Customize and reuse the modules or scripts as needed for your project infrastructure and pipeline setup.

## 🔄 Reusability Guidelines
- Keep variables generic in Terraform modules and Ansible roles.
- Version each module or playbook if used in production workflows.
- Document inputs/outputs in each submodule for clarity.
